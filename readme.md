# Lab | Cleaning numerical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder.

## Context

An auto insurance company has collected some data about its customers including their _demographics_, _education_, _employment_, _policy details_, _vehicle information_ on which insurance policy is, and _claim amounts_. You will help the senior management with some business questions that will help them to better understand their customers, improve their services, and improve profitability.

**Some business Objectives**:

- Retain customers,
- Analyze relevant customer data,
- Develop focused customer retention programs.

Based on the analysis, take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the `we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv` into the variable `customer_df`.
3. First look at its main features (`head`, `shape`, `info`).
4. Rename the columns so they follow the _PE8_ (snake case).
5. Change effective to date column to datetime format.
6. Check `NaN` values per column.
7. Define a function that differentiates between continuous and discrete variables. **Hint**: A number of unique values might be useful. Store continuous data into a `continuous` variable and do the same for `discrete` and categorical.
8. For the categorical data, check if there is some kind of text in a variable so we would need to clean it. **Hint**: Use the same method you used in step 7. Depending on the implementation, decide what to do with the variables you get.
9. Get categorical features.
10. What should we do with the `customer_id` column?
